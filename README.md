### Overview
The repository serves as a supplemental material provider for several cybersecurity classes taught by Dr. Kisow, enhancing the learning experience by offering a wide range of resources. These materials may include lecture notes, lab exercises, reading lists, and additional reference documents that align with the course curricula. By providing access to current and relevant cybersecurity information, the repository supports students in gaining a deeper understanding of complex topics such as network security, cryptography, ethical hacking, and information assurance. Furthermore, the repository is regularly updated to reflect the latest developments and best practices in the field, ensuring that students have access to the most up-to-date knowledge and tools necessary for their academic and professional success. This centralized resource hub also encourages self-paced learning and allows students to review and reinforce their understanding of key concepts outside the classroom.

### Tags
Every article will be assigned one or more tags that indicate its relevance to particular courses. These tags ensure that students can easily identify which materials align with their specific learning objectives and curriculum requirements. While all the information in this repository is broadly relevant to the field of cybersecurity, certain articles are tailored to meet the specific learning outcomes of individual classes. This tagging system not only enhances this repository’s utility as an educational tool but also supports a focused and outcome-driven approach to cybersecurity education. By aligning resources with course-specific goals, I aim to provide a more effective and personalized learning experience.
