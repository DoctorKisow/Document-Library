A Dutch engineer, Erik van Sabben, reportedly used a water pump to deploy the Stuxnet malware into an Iranian nuclear facility, according to a Dutch newspaper investigation. Recruited by Dutch intelligence in collaboration with American and Israeli agencies, van Sabben's technical background and business ties to Iran made him a suitable candidate. The malware caused significant damage to Iran's nuclear centrifuges. Van Sabben died in a motorcycle accident shortly after the attack, and the details of his involvement remain partly disputed [^1].
