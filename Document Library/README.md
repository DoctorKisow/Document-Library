# Document Library Usage
*This repository is systematically organized into several key sections, ensuring a comprehensive and structured approach to learning. The sections are as follows: Cybersecurity Frameworks, Cybersecurity Regulations, and Various Articles of Interest. Each article within these sections will be meticulously tagged to correspond with specific cybersecurity classes, facilitating targeted learning and efficient resource allocation.
<br/><br/>
Every article will be assigned one or more tags that indicate its relevance to particular courses. These tags ensure that students can easily identify which materials align with their specific learning objectives and curriculum requirements. While all the information in this repository is broadly relevant to the field of cybersecurity, certain articles are tailored to meet the specific learning outcomes of individual classes.
<br/><br/>
This tagging system not only enhances this repositoryâ€™s utility as an educational tool but also supports a focused and outcome-driven approach to cybersecurity education. By aligning resources with course-specific goals, I aim to provide a more effective and personalized learning experience.*
