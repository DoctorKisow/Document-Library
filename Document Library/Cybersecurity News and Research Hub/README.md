:link: [Hackers Steal 15,000 Cloud Credentials from Exposed GIT Config Files](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-steal-15-000-cloud-credentials-from-exposed-git-config-files/)

A large-scale malicious operation, dubbed "EmeraldWhale," has been identified, targeting exposed Git configuration files to harvest over 15,000 cloud account credentials from thousands of private repositories. The attackers employed automated tools to scan extensive IP ranges for accessible Git configuration files, which often contain authentication tokens. These tokens were then utilized to download repositories from platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket, subsequently scanning them for additional credentials. The exfiltrated data was stored in Amazon S3 buckets belonging to other victims and was used in phishing and spam campaigns or sold to other cybercriminals. 

Git configuration files, like /.git/config or .gitlab-ci.yml, are essential for defining repository paths, branches, remotes, and sometimes include sensitive information such as API keys and passwords. Developers may inadvertently expose these files, especially if the /.git directory is accessible on a website, making it susceptible to automated scans by threat actors. The EmeraldWhale operation utilized open-source tools to scan approximately 500 million IP addresses, identifying exposed configuration files and environment files in Laravel applications. The campaign resulted in the theft of 15,000 cloud credentials from 67,000 URLs, with 2,000 of these credentials validated as active. This incident underscores the critical importance of securing Git repositories and implementing robust secret management practices to prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches [^1].

📄 [Sun Tzu and the Art of Cyberwar](Sun%20Tzu%20and%20the%20Art%20of%20Cyberwar.pdf)<br/>

Roy Wilson's article, "Sun Tzu and the Art of Cyberwar," explores the applicability of Sun Tzu's timeless strategies from The Art of War to modern cyberwarfare. Wilson, a cybersecurity professor with extensive military experience, argues that Sun Tzu’s 13 strategic chapters contain equally relevant insights in cyber contexts, from proactive planning and adaptability to exploiting adversary vulnerabilities. For instance, tactics like “Laying Plans” and “Attack by Stratagem” resonate with concepts like honeypots and botnets, where cyber forces utilize traps or commandeered resources to outmaneuver adversaries. Similarly, principles around knowing one's strengths and weaknesses and harnessing foreknowledge align with cybersecurity defense strategies like threat intelligence and proactive defense.

Wilson further suggests that cyberwarfare requires resilience, secrecy, and adaptability akin to Sun Tzu's teachings on tactical dispositions and maneuvering. The cyber domain emphasizes rapid, stealthy operations, attacking unguarded points and preparing defensive systems against known and unknown threats. Ultimately, Wilson underscores that while cyber warfare diverges from traditional combat, the ancient wisdom of Sun Tzu provides foundational principles that modern cybersecurity professionals can use to anticipate, withstand, and counteract sophisticated cyber threats [^8].

In 2013, a story emerged about a U.S. software developer who outsourced his job to China. The developer, referred to as "Bob," worked for a critical infrastructure company and earned a six-figure salary. He hired a Chinese firm to do his job for about one-fifth of his salary, allowing him to spend his workdays surfing the Internet, including watching cat videos on YouTube and browsing social media. This scheme was discovered during a security audit when unusual VPN activity from China was detected. Bob had even sent his RSA security token to China to facilitate the login process for the outsourced workers. Despite receiving excellent performance reviews, Bob was eventually fired for violating company policy when the deception came to light​ [^10].
