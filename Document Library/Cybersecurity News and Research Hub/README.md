A large-scale malicious operation, dubbed "EmeraldWhale," has been identified, targeting exposed Git configuration files to harvest over 15,000 cloud account credentials from thousands of private repositories. The attackers employed automated tools to scan extensive IP ranges for accessible Git configuration files, which often contain authentication tokens. These tokens were then utilized to download repositories from platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket, subsequently scanning them for additional credentials. The exfiltrated data was stored in Amazon S3 buckets belonging to other victims and was used in phishing and spam campaigns or sold to other cybercriminals. 

Git configuration files, like /.git/config or .gitlab-ci.yml, are essential for defining repository paths, branches, remotes, and sometimes include sensitive information such as API keys and passwords. Developers may inadvertently expose these files, especially if the /.git directory is accessible on a website, making it susceptible to automated scans by threat actors. The EmeraldWhale operation utilized open-source tools to scan approximately 500 million IP addresses, identifying exposed configuration files and environment files in Laravel applications. The campaign resulted in the theft of 15,000 cloud credentials from 67,000 URLs, with 2,000 of these credentials validated as active. This incident underscores the critical importance of securing Git repositories and implementing robust secret management practices to prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches [^1].
