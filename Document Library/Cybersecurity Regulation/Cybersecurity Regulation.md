# Cybersecurity Regulation
*Cybersecurity regulation encompasses a set of rules, standards, and guidelines established by governments or industry bodies to protect digital systems, networks, and data from cyber threats. Its primary objective is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and systems in the face of increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks. These regulations typically outline requirements for organizations to implement security controls, conduct risk assessments, and report breaches. By setting clear standards and enforcing compliance, cybersecurity regulation aims to mitigate risks, safeguard sensitive information, and enhance overall resilience against cyber threats in an interconnected world.*

The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMPÂ®) was established in 2011 to provide a cost-effective, risk-based approach for the adoption and use of cloud services by the federal government. FedRAMP empowers agencies to use modern cloud technologies, with an emphasis on the security and protection of federal information. In December 2022, the FedRAMP Authorization Act was signed as part of the FY23 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The Act codifies the FedRAMP program as the authoritative standardized approach to security assessment and authorization for cloud computing products and services that process unclassified federal information [^7].

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data protection law enacted by the European Union (EU) to regulate the processing of personal data. Implemented in May 2018, GDPR aims to strengthen individuals' rights regarding their personal information and harmonize data protection laws across EU member states. It requires organizations to obtain explicit consent for data processing, provide transparent information about how data is used, and take measures to ensure data security. GDPR also empowers individuals with rights such as the right to access, rectify, and erase their data. The regulation imposes hefty fines for non-compliance, serving as a deterrent to organizations mishandling personal data and fostering a culture of accountability and data protection [^2].

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) was developed to encourage and enhance payment card account data security and facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures globally. PCI DSS provides a baseline of technical and operational requirements designed to protect account data. While specifically designed to focus on environments with payment card account data, PCI DSS can also be used to protect against threats and secure other elements in the payment ecosystem [^5].
