# 📁 Cybersecurity Frameworks
*Cybersecurity frameworks are structured sets of guidelines, best practices, and standards designed to help organizations manage and improve their cybersecurity posture. These frameworks serve as comprehensive frameworks that outline systematic approaches to identify, assess, and mitigate cybersecurity risks, as well as establish effective cybersecurity programs. They typically include guidelines for defining cybersecurity policies, implementing security controls, managing incidents, and conducting risk assessments. Cybersecurity frameworks provide organizations with a structured and standardized approach to cybersecurity, helping them align with industry best practices, regulatory requirements, and emerging threats. By adopting and implementing cybersecurity frameworks, organizations can enhance their resilience to cyber threats, protect critical assets and data, and maintain the trust and confidence of their stakeholders.*

:link: [Empire](https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire)<br/>

Empire is a post-exploitation framework that includes a pure-PowerShell2.0 Windows agent, and a pure Python 2.6/2.7 Linux/OS X agent. It is the merge of the previous PowerShell Empire and Python EmPyre projects. The framework offers cryptologically-secure communications and a flexible architecture. On the PowerShell side, Empire implements the ability to run PowerShell agents without needing powershell.exe, rapidly deployable post-exploitation modules ranging from key loggers to Mimikatz, and adaptable communications to evade network detection, all wrapped up in a usability-focused framework. PowerShell Empire premiered at [BSidesLV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq9t59w0mUI) in 2015 and Python EmPyre premiered at HackMiami in 2016 [^1].

:link: [OWASP WSTG Testing Framework](https://owasp.org/www-project-owtf/)<br/>

The OWASP WSTG (Web Security Testing Guide) framework is a comprehensive resource developed by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) that provides practical guidance and methodologies for testing the security of web applications. Designed to assist security professionals, developers, and organizations in identifying and mitigating common security vulnerabilities within web applications, the WSTG offers a structured approach to conducting security assessments, penetration testing, and vulnerability analysis. The framework covers a wide range of topics, including authentication, authorization, input validation, session management, and security configuration, and provides detailed testing techniques and best practices for each area. By following the guidelines outlined in the OWASP WSTG, practitioners can effectively assess the security posture of web applications and implement appropriate countermeasures to protect against potential threats and attacks.
