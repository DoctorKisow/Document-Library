# 📁 Cybersecurity Frameworks
*Cybersecurity frameworks are structured sets of guidelines, best practices, and standards designed to help organizations manage and improve their cybersecurity posture. These frameworks serve as comprehensive frameworks that outline systematic approaches to identify, assess, and mitigate cybersecurity risks, as well as establish effective cybersecurity programs. They typically include guidelines for defining cybersecurity policies, implementing security controls, managing incidents, and conducting risk assessments. Cybersecurity frameworks provide organizations with a structured and standardized approach to cybersecurity, helping them align with industry best practices, regulatory requirements, and emerging threats. By adopting and implementing cybersecurity frameworks, organizations can enhance their resilience to cyber threats, protect critical assets and data, and maintain the trust and confidence of their stakeholders.*

Empire is a post-exploitation framework that includes a pure-PowerShell2.0 Windows agent, and a pure Python 2.6/2.7 Linux/OS X agent. It is the merge of the previous PowerShell Empire and Python EmPyre projects. The framework offers cryptologically-secure communications and a flexible architecture. On the PowerShell side, Empire implements the ability to run PowerShell agents without needing powershell.exe, rapidly deployable post-exploitation modules ranging from key loggers to Mimikatz, and adaptable communications to evade network detection, all wrapped up in a usability-focused framework. PowerShell Empire premiered at [BSidesLV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq9t59w0mUI) in 2015 and Python EmPyre premiered at HackMiami in 2016 [^1].

:link: [OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html)<br/>

The OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet provides a comprehensive guide to implementing secure authentication mechanisms in web applications. It emphasizes the importance of using multi-factor authentication (MFA), recommends avoiding deprecated authentication methods such as password-based logins, and stresses the necessity of secure storage for credentials. The cheat sheet advises on best practices for password policies, session management, and handling authentication errors securely. It also includes recommendations for implementing account recovery processes and integrating third-party authentication services like OAuth and OpenID Connect. Overall, it serves as a crucial resource for developers to ensure robust authentication and protect against common security threats​ [^3].

The OWASP SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet provides comprehensive guidelines to defend against SQL injection attacks, a prevalent and dangerous security vulnerability. It emphasizes the use of parameterized queries and prepared statements to safely execute SQL commands. Developers are advised to avoid dynamic SQL generation and instead use Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks, stored procedures, or safer alternatives like the Hibernate Query Language (HQL). Proper input validation and sanitization are critical, particularly when dealing with user inputs. The cheat sheet also suggests the implementation of a least privilege principle, ensuring that the database user has the minimum necessary permissions. Additionally, regular security testing and code reviews are recommended to identify and rectify potential vulnerabilities early in the development process​​ [^4].

The OWASP WSTG (Web Security Testing Guide) framework is a comprehensive resource developed by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) that provides practical guidance and methodologies for testing the security of web applications. Designed to assist security professionals, developers, and organizations in identifying and mitigating common security vulnerabilities within web applications, the WSTG offers a structured approach to conducting security assessments, penetration testing, and vulnerability analysis. The framework covers a wide range of topics, including authentication, authorization, input validation, session management, and security configuration, and provides detailed testing techniques and best practices for each area. By following the guidelines outlined in the OWASP WSTG, practitioners can effectively assess the security posture of web applications and implement appropriate countermeasures to protect against potential threats and attacks.
