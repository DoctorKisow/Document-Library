This special publication outlines the NIST Cloud Computing Reference Architecture (RA) and Taxonomy, developed to facilitate the understanding and adoption of cloud computing within the U.S. government. The document provides a comprehensive framework that describes the various components and roles within cloud computing, ensuring a consistent and vendor-neutral approach. The RA identifies five primary roles: Cloud Consumer, Cloud Provider, Cloud Broker, Cloud Auditor, and Cloud Carrier, each with distinct responsibilities and interactions. The architecture also addresses service deployment, orchestration, management, security, and privacy, aiming to create a standardized and interoperable cloud environment that supports innovation and offers a reliable basis for comparing cloud services. The taxonomy offers a clear classification of cloud services, enhancing clarity and communication among stakeholders [^1].

This publication provides a catalog of security and privacy controls for information systems and organizations to protect organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation from a diverse set of threats and risks, including hostile attacks, human errors, natural disasters, structural failures, foreign intelligence entities, and privacy risks. The controls are flexible and customizable and implemented as part of an organization-wide process to manage risk. The controls address diverse requirements derived from mission and business needs, laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Finally, the consolidated control catalog addresses security and privacy from a functionality perspective (i.e., the strength of functions and mechanisms provided by the controls) and from an assurance perspective (i.e., the measure of confidence in the security or privacy capability provided by the controls). Addressing functionality and assurance helps to ensure that information technology products and the systems that rely on those products are sufficiently trustworthy [^5].

NIST Special Publication 800-88 Revision 1, titled "Guidelines for Media Sanitization," provides comprehensive guidance on the sanitization of digital media to ensure that data is rendered irretrievable. This publication helps organizations and system owners make informed decisions about media sanitization based on the confidentiality levels of their data. It covers various methods and tools for sanitizing different types of media, including physical destruction, cryptographic erasure, and data overwriting. The guidelines emphasize the importance of media sanitization throughout the lifecycle of information systems to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure [^6].

NIST Special Publication 800-145, establishes a standardized definition and framework for cloud computing. It identifies five essential characteristics: on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service. The publication also defines three service models‚ÄîSoftware as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)‚Äîand four deployment models‚Äîprivate cloud, community cloud, public cloud, and hybrid cloud. This framework helps organizations understand and adopt cloud technologies while ensuring consistency and clarity in cloud computing discussions and implementations‚Äã [^3].

üîó [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)<br/>

NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a set of guidelines for mitigating organizational cybersecurity risks, published by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology based on existing standards, guidelines, and practices. The framework "provides a high-level taxonomy of cybersecurity outcomes and a methodology to assess and manage those outcomes", in addition to guidance on the protection of privacy and civil liberties in a cybersecurity context. It has been translated into many languages and is used by several governments and a wide range of businesses and organizations. A 2016 study found that 70% of organizations surveyed see the NIST Cybersecurity Framework as a popular best practice for computer security, but many note that it requires significant investment.
