Researchers uncovered a sophisticated attack that backdoored iPhones over four years, exploiting a secret hardware feature unknown outside Apple and ARM. The attack targeted employees of Kaspersky and potentially thousands more, using iMessage to install spyware without user interaction. Four zero-day vulnerabilities, including in the iPhone kernel, were exploited, allowing attackers to bypass advanced memory protections. This campaign, called "Operation Triangulation," is one of the most sophisticated attacks to date, affecting various Apple devices. The vulnerabilities have since been patched by Apple. [^1].

This paper examines vulnerabilities in the RC4 encryption algorithm as implemented in the WPA-TKIP and TLS protocols. The authors identify new biases in the RC4 keystream, facilitating advanced plaintext recovery attacks. For WPA-TKIP, the research demonstrates an efficient method to decrypt and exploit packets, deriving the MIC key for packet injection and decryption within an hour. For TLS, they present a practical attack on HTTPS cookies, leveraging RC4 biases and brute-force methods to decrypt secure cookies in approximately 75 hours. The findings highlight critical weaknesses in RC4, emphasizing the need to transition to more secure cryptographic algorithms [^4].

üìÑ [Biclique cryptanalysis of the full AES](Biclique%20cryptanalysis%20of%20the%20full%20AES.pdf)

This paper introduces biclique cryptanalysis, a novel method for analyzing block ciphers, and applies it to the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The authors present the first key recovery techniques for the full AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256, achieving computational complexities of 2<sup>126.1</sup>, 2<sup>189.7</sup>, 2<sup>189.7</sup>, respectively, which are slightly faster than brute force. Biclique cryptanalysis operates without assuming related-key scenarios and requires minimal data and memory. Despite the computational improvements, the authors affirm that these methods do not compromise the practical security of AES. The study provides a foundational framework for extending cryptanalytic tools to more complex cryptographic systems while ensuring that AES remains robust against practical attacks.[^5].

üìÑ [A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public-Key Cryptosystems](A%20Method%20for%20Obtaining%20Digital%20Signatures%20and%20Public-Key%20Cryptosystems.pdf)

This landmark paper introduces the RSA algorithm, the first practical implementation of a public-key cryptosystem. The authors describe a method where encryption and decryption keys are distinct, allowing the public disclosure of encryption keys without compromising the security of decryption keys. This method relies on the mathematical difficulty of factoring large composite numbers, providing both data confidentiality and digital signatures for authentication and non-repudiation. The RSA algorithm is based on modular arithmetic and exponentiation, ensuring efficiency and security under practical constraints. This innovation forms the foundation of modern cryptographic applications, including secure communications, electronic transactions, and digital certificates [^6].

üìÑ [New Directions in Cryptography](New%20Directions%20in%20Cryptography.pdf)

This seminal paper by Diffie and Hellman introduced the concept of public-key cryptography, a revolutionary advancement enabling secure communication over insecure channels without prior shared secrets. The authors proposed a framework where encryption and decryption processes rely on separate keys: a publicly accessible encryption key and a private decryption key. This approach addressed challenges in secure key distribution, exemplified through the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange protocol, which allows two parties to establish a shared secret over an untrusted network. The work also explored authentication mechanisms and laid the groundwork for cryptographic protocols ensuring message integrity, confidentiality, and non-repudiation. Their contributions fundamentally transformed modern cryptography, underpinning digital security frameworks such as TLS, SSL, and digital signatures [^7].

üîó [Two never-before-seen tools, from same group, infect air-gapped devices.](https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/10/two-never-before-seen-tools-from-same-group-infect-air-gapped-devices/)

Researchers have uncovered two sophisticated toolsets created by a nation-state group, potentially linked to Russia, for compromising air-gapped systems‚Äîdevices isolated from any network to enhance security. The first toolkit surfaced in 2019, targeting a South Asian embassy in Belarus, while a similar but more advanced toolkit was later used against a European Union government agency. Developed by a group ESET and Kaspersky researchers call GoldenJackal, these tools circumvent air-gapping by infecting USB drives and transferring data from air-gapped devices to the Internet once plugged into a connected system. The modular design of these toolkits allows for highly targeted espionage, utilizing components like file collectors, exfiltration mechanisms, and updated versions in different programming languages for flexibility. This level of sophistication is rare, underscoring GoldenJackal‚Äôs resourcefulness and capability to conduct highly customized, stealthy attacks aimed at obtaining sensitive information.

ESET‚Äôs findings suggest that GoldenJackal may be associated with the Russian-linked group Turla, known for similar malware used in high-level espionage. The research reveals GoldenJackal's growing interest in European targets, adding to their previous focus on the Middle East. This discovery highlights evolving tactics used in espionage on air-gapped systems, marking a need for heightened vigilance in government and diplomatic cybersecurity, particularly in embassies and organizations previously targeted by groups like Turla or Red October [^2].

A cyberattack linked to the Chinese government has infiltrated the networks of major U.S. broadband providers, including AT&T and Verizon, potentially compromising systems used for court-authorized wiretaps. The hackers, identified as the group "Salt Typhoon," may have accessed sensitive information from these wiretap systems, posing significant national security concerns. The breach underscores the escalating threat of cyber espionage targeting critical U.S. infrastructure[^3].
