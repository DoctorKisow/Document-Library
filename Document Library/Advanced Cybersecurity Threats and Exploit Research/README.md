# 📁 Advanced Cybersecurity Threats and Exploit Research
*Advanced Cybersecurity Threats and Exploit Research contains in-depth analyses, reports, and case studies on critical cybersecurity vulnerabilities, zero-day exploits, and sophisticated attack campaigns. It includes research on targeted attacks, such as those involving undisclosed hardware features, malware, and spyware that compromise systems like iPhones, iPads, and other devices. The content in this folder is intended for understanding advanced security threats and the technical mechanisms attackers use to bypass modern protections, making it valuable for cybersecurity professionals and researchers.*

Researchers uncovered a sophisticated attack that backdoored iPhones over four years, exploiting a secret hardware feature unknown outside Apple and ARM. The attack targeted employees of Kaspersky and potentially thousands more, using iMessage to install spyware without user interaction. Four zero-day vulnerabilities, including in the iPhone kernel, were exploited, allowing attackers to bypass advanced memory protections. This campaign, called "Operation Triangulation," is one of the most sophisticated attacks to date, affecting various Apple devices. The vulnerabilities have since been patched by Apple. [^1].
