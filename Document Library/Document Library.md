Android fragmentation refers to the phenomenon within the Android ecosystem where the platform's user base is spread across numerous device manufacturers, models, versions, and customized software implementations. This results in a diverse array of hardware capabilities, software versions, and user experiences across Android devices. Fragmentation can present challenges for developers aiming to create apps that perform consistently across the Android ecosystem, as they must contend with varying screen sizes, resolutions, hardware specifications, and software versions. Additionally, device manufacturers and carriers often introduce their customizations and modifications to the Android operating system, further exacerbating fragmentation by creating inconsistencies in user interfaces and feature sets. Addressing fragmentation requires careful consideration of compatibility, testing, and optimization strategies to ensure a seamless user experience across the diverse range of Android devices [^2],[^3].

<br/>
**Early in the** morning on October 21, 2016, Scott Shapiro got out of bed, opened his Dell laptop to read the day’s news, and found that the internet was broken.
<br/><br/>
Not his internet, though at first it struck Shapiro that way as he checked and double-checked his computer’s Wi-Fi connection and his router. The internet.
<br/><br/>
The New York Times website was offline, as was Twitter. So too were the websites of The Guardian, The Wall Street Journal, CNN, the BBC, and Fox News. (And WIRED.) When Twitter intermittently sputtered back online, users cataloged an alarming, untold number of other digital services that were also victims of the outage. Amazon, Spotify, Reddit, PayPal, Airbnb, Slack, SoundCloud, HBO, and Netflix were all, to varying degrees, crippled for most of the East Coast of the United States and other patches of the country.
<br/><br/>
Shapiro, a very online professor at Yale Law School who was teaching a new class on cyber conflict that year, found the blackout deeply disorienting and isolating. A presidential election unlike any other in US history loomed in just under three weeks. “October surprises” seemed to be piling up: Earlier that month, US intelligence agencies had jointly announced that hacker breaches of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign had in fact been carried out by the Russian government. Meanwhile, Julian Assange’s WikiLeaks had been publishing the leaked emails from those hacks, pounding out a drumbeat of scandalous headlines. Spooked cybersecurity analysts feared that a more climactic cyberattack might strike on Election Day itself, throwing the country into chaos.
<br/><br/>
Those anxieties had been acutely primed just a month earlier by a blog post written by the famed cryptographer and security guru Bruce Schneier. It was titled “Someone Is Learning How to Take Down the Internet.”
<br/><br/>
“Over the past year or two, someone has been probing the defenses of the companies that run critical pieces of the internet,” Schneier, one of the most highly respected voices in the cybersecurity community, had warned. He described how an unknown force appeared to be repeatedly barraging this key infrastructure with relentless waves of malicious traffic at a scale that had never been seen before. “These probes take the form of precisely calibrated attacks designed to determine exactly how well these companies can defend themselves, and what would be required to take them down. We don’t know who is doing this, but it feels like a large nation-state. China or Russia would be my first guesses.”
<br/><br/>
Now it seemed to Shapiro that Schneier’s warning was coming to fruition, right on schedule. “This is the attack,” he remembers thinking. Was it “the big one?” he asked himself. Or was it perhaps a test for the true “big one” that would hit on November 8? “Obviously, it has to be a nation-state,” Shapiro thought. “It has to be the Russians.”
<br/><br/>
For Shapiro, the internet outage was a kind of turning point: In the months and years that followed, he would become obsessed with trying to understand how someone could simply stamp out such a large swath of digital connectivity across the world, who would do such a thing, and why. But meanwhile, a little less than 500 miles west of Shapiro’s Connecticut home, in the town of Washington, Pennsylvania, another sort of observer was watching the attack unfold.
<br/><br/>
After a typical sleepless night at his keyboard, 19-year-old Josiah White sat staring at the three flatscreen monitors he’d set up on a workbench in a messy basement storage area connected to the bedroom he shared with his brother in their parents’ house. He was surrounded by computer equipment—old hard drives and a friend’s desktop machine he had offered to fix—and boxes of his family’s toys and Christmas tree ornaments.
<br/><br/>
For weeks, a cyber weapon that he’d built with two of his young friends, Paras Jha and Dalton Norman, had wreaked havoc across the internet, blasting victims offline in one unprecedented attack after another. As the damage mounted, Josiah had grown accustomed to the thrills, the anxiety, the guilt, the sense that it had all gotten so absurdly out of hand—and the thought that he was now probably being hunted by law enforcement agencies around the world.
<br/><br/>
He’d reached a state of numbness, compartmentalizing his dread even as he read Bruce Schneier’s doomsday post and understood that it was describing his own work—and now, even as a White House press secretary assured reporters in a streamed press conference that the Department of Homeland Security was investigating the mass outage that had resulted directly from his actions.
<br/><br/>
But what Josiah remembers feeling above all else was simply awe—awe at the scale and chaotic power of the Frankenstein’s monster that he and his friends had unleashed. Awe at how thoroughly it had now escaped their control. Awe that the internet itself was being shaken to its foundations by this thing that three young hackers had built in a flurry of adolescent emotions, whims, rivalries, rationalizations, and mistakes. A thing called Mirai [^5].

<br/>
The article "Rage-quit coder unpublished 17 lines of JavaScript and broke the internet" by Ars Technica describes an incident involving a developer named Azer Koçulu, who removed his small but widely-used JavaScript package called "left-pad" from the npm (Node Package Manager) repository. This package, containing only 17 lines of code, was a dependency for many popular projects, including those managed by major companies.

Koçulu's decision to unpublish his package stemmed from a dispute with npm over another package he had named "Kik", which conflicted with the name of a popular messaging app. npm sided with the app's developers, prompting Koçulu to remove all his packages in protest.

The sudden removal of "left-pad" caused widespread disruption, breaking thousands of builds and highlighting the dependency problems within the JavaScript ecosystem. The incident sparked discussions about the reliability of open-source software, dependency management, and the responsibilities of maintainers [^9].

Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIP) are emerging technology supporting organizations as they consume and then act on cyber intelligence. Lockheed Martin believes that a TIP helps an organization transition from relying solely on external intelligence sources to producing their intelligence based on what is observed in their environment. The  result is elevated cyber maturity and improved resilience against attackers [^11].
